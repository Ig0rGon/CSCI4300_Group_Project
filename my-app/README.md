Project Name: Bulldog Market

Description:
Bulldog Market is designed to streamline transactions between University of Georgia (UGA) students and individuals in the greater Athens area. Users can browse all available items, with the ability to post or delete listings only upon signing in. The platform incorporates authentication to ensure a safer and more reliable environment for both buyers and sellers. Bulldog Market also features item categorization and GPS-based location tracking to display the proximity of items. Whether purchasing a used textbook, selling a dorm fridge, or trading event tickets, Bulldog Market simplifies and secures campus-centric commerce.
